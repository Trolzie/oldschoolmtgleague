	<h1>Greetings oldschoolians, and weclome to Old School MTG League.</h1>

	<p>The popularity of oldschool magic has been on the rise for some time now, and although prices keep surging, we all still keep buying. To help our concience deal with our maxed credit cards and angry spouses, we need people we can start slinging our old pieces of cardboard at.</p>
	<p>To solve this dilemma, We asked Leonard Kleinrock to go back in time to May 31st, 1961. We had him publish his first paper entitled "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets" on our behalf. The idea presented then later evolved to become a global scale series of networks, and is what we today know as the internet.</p>
	<p>This meant that today, roughly 60 years later, our idea prevailed and pushed technology to become powerful enough to connect fellow mages and wizards, and fight for glory with ancient artifacts, creatures and spells. (You are quite welcome, world!)</p>
	<p>The Oldschool MTG League is battleground set in this digital realm, and we encourage every spellslinger, apprentice or master, to summon beasts of old, tricks and spells and join us for some old school Magic!</p>
